# What is a commodity?

- A basic good used in commerce, usually a raw material that is used to manufacture finished goods.
- for example: timber, gold and oil.

## What are commodity markets dependent on?

- A lot of natural factors that are unforseen and out of human control. For example wild fires/hurricanes

- Futures contracts are exchanged by traders to try and limit some of the valatility. 

- - Financial traders profit from the volatility by placign bets on which way they think the market will swing.

## What is a futures contract?

- An agreement between two parties for a delivery of a commodity at a future date. They usually run on a monthly basis.

- Buying them can protect both parties from price fluctuations in the market. (e.g farmer and manufacturer, whatever output is locked into the contract is protected)

## What determines an increase in price?

- It usually means there is a huge shocked supply (shortage on supply) or there is a surge in demand.

- When futures prices are high, manufacturers pay more for contracts. Retailers are charged more --> Consumers are charged more.
